# Payment Challenge - ID NDSC 2020
Hi, I am Muhammad Ihsan Prasetio. I and my friends participated Shopee ID NDSC 2020 in Beginner Category. There are two challenges in Beginner Category. One of them is Payment Matching. This is how to solve Payment Matching challenge in beginner way.

## Description
At Shopee, bank transfer is a payment method in most countries. When a buyer chooses to place an order using bank transfer, he/she is supposed to make the transfer within 2 days after he/she places the order.

After he/she makes the transfer, Shopee will receive a bank statement from the bank and Shopee needs to compare and match the bank statement with the checkout information in order to confirm that this particular order has been paid. This process is called payment matching.

Two criteria need to be met in order to match a bank statement with a checkout:

- Amount match: Statement amount equals checkout amount.
- Name match: Statement description “matches” checkout buyer name (Note: statement description usually contains buyer name)

A proper match occurs when both the amount and the name matches on both bank statement and checkout list.

## Task
Based on the two criteria, please match the Bank Statement IDs to the Checkout IDs. Please note that in the dataset provided, there are unique matches of each bank statement and checkout.

## Example
Please find below a few examples of matches:
